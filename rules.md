# Basic rules

These are rules that all users of the common disk space should adhere to.

* The basic path structure is as follows:

    - One folder per user. Create your own folder and *use a sensible name*.

    - The folder `data` should contain common datafiles, such as databases

    - The folder `scripts` should contain common scripts

    - The folder `backup` should contain backup data for all users

* In your own user-folder you can have whatever structure you want, but consider that one day someone else might be looking for one of your files.
